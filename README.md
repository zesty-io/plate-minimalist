Minimalist features social media icons to the top right of the page, a large image slider in the header, a navigation bar on top of image slider to right, 2 rows of a horizontal bar with 3 squares underneath, a footer, 4 pre-loaded pages: page, blog, contact, and our portfolio, which includes 2 sub-pages.
Although these pages are pre-loaded, please note that all Zesty.io templates are completely customizable.
